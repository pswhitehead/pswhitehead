### Human Perception and Performance
  How do you avoid accidents while driving? How do you make the right decision when it matters? I use behavior and eye tracking methods to better understand these behaviors, specifically focussing on the how people learn to successfully and automatically implement context-appropriate behavior.

### Memory and Attention
  How do you find your keys in the morning, or remember where you left your bag? I use EEG and behavior to better understand how what you keep in memory influences what you pay attention to.

### Individual Differences
  What makes one person choose product A over product B? Another the reverse? I use large scale behavioral assessments to understand individual differences in cognition and decision making between people, with a focus on higher-order processes such as executive function and cognitive control.
