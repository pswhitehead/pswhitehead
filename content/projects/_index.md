### Human Learning and Performance
  How do you avoid accidents while driving? How do you make the right decision when it matters? How can you transfer your learning in one situation to another? I use behavior and eye tracking methods to better understand these behaviors, specifically focusing on how people learn to successfully and automatically implement context-appropriate behavior.

### Individual Differences
  What makes one person choose product A over product B? Another the reverse? I use large scale behavioral assessments to understand individual differences in cognition and decision making between people, with a focus on higher-order processes such as executive function and cognitive control.

### Side Projects
  Here are just some short blog-post style projects I have done. This is not updated regularly.
  
  * An exercise using a publicly available SQL database on housing loans. [SEE HERE](https://pswhitehead.com/post/blog1/).
  
  * Building a webscraper to add property record data to my SQL server. [SEE HERE](https://pswhitehead.com/post/blog2/).
